## Pull Request Process

1. Pull requests should be made against master branch, which is also our latest stable version.
2. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a 
   build.
3. Update the documentation with details of changes, this includes new environment variables, and useful
   file locations.
4. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
